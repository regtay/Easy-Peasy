## Task 1 ##
**Enumeration Through Nmap**

How many ports are open?

```

```

* nmap -A -p- < ipaddress >

*-A (Aggressive scan options)*

*-p- (port ranges)*

What is the version of nginx?

* nginx version was shown in nmap scan

What is running on the highest port?

* The highest port is 11 away for the total number of networking ports (65535)

## Task 2 ##

**Compromising the machine**

Using GoBuster, find flag 1.

```
dirbuster -H -u http://--.--.---.--- -l /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 200

Picked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.aatext=true
Starting OWASP DirBuster 1.0-RC1
Starting dir/file list based brute forcing
Dir found: / - 200
Dir found: /------/ - 200
Dir found: /------/--------/ - 200

Unfortunately I was unable to get this to work without the GUI
```

This is the command used to find the first flag, flag was located

* < --.--.---.---/h-----/w------- >

Once I was on this page, I decided to view the sourcepages.

* Noticed a base64 string

* echo "base64 string" > < filename >

* base64 -d < filename > to decode string

*-d decode data*

"WALAH" there goes the first flag

Taking a bow Easy Peasy lemon squeezy

Further enumerate the machine, what is flag 2?

From earlier notes I noticed a file *------.txt*
I didn't think it would hurt to check it out at some point once I did
*Wamb Bamb Money Gram*

```

hash-identifier I thought would be a good tool for this guy it pointed me in the right

direction but no *Chicken Dinner*

On the hunt now, after using *The Cyber Swiss Army Knife* no Luck.

Now on to my backup tool *md5hashing.net* Well lets just say that *Swiss Army Knife was dull*

Crack the hash with easypeasy.txt, What is the flag 3?

Don't truly understand why I would need to crack flag 3 stumbled across this sitting in plain
view on one of the pages --.--.---.---:-----

* But I thought it would be fun if I tried it anyway, nothing. I think this was a typo intended
for another question.

What is the hidden directory?

Any time I visit a page, I find it to be good practice to always view the page source
```
page source --.--.---.---:-----

<div class="main_page">
      <div class="page_header floating_element">
        <img src="/icons/openlogo-75.png" alt="Debian Logo" class="floating_element"/>
        <span class="floating_element">
          Apache 2 It Works For Me
	<p hidden>its encoded with ba....:O----------------------u</p>
        </span>
      </div>
```

So I had to sharpen my *Cyber Swiss Army Knife* comes to find out it decided to cut away

at this base62 string O----------------------u

/n---------------r is what it came with, what do I do with this now.

Using the wordlist that provided to you in this task crack the hash

After locating hidden directory, navigate to

--.--.---.---:/n---------------r

```
view page source
